:::{grid-item-card}
:link: https://github.com/y-scope/clp
CLP (clp)
^^^
A tool that can compress both text and JSON logs with higher compression than general-purpose
compressors while allowing search without full decompression. CLP can run as a large distributed
system and includes a UI.

clp-logging (clp-loglib-py)
^^^
A Python `logging` library providing lightweight and real-time compression into CLP's IR format.

:link: https://github.com/y-scope/log4j1-appenders
Log4j 1 appenders (log4j1-appenders)
^^^
Useful appenders for Log4j 1 including features like lightweight, real-time compression into CLP's
IR format.

:::{grid-item-card}
:link: https://github.com/y-scope/clp-ffi-go
clp-ffi-go
^^^
A Go library exposing an interface to CLP's core. It currently supports CLP's core encoding
and decoding logic as well as serializing, deserializing, searching, and analyzing CLP IR files.
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
:link: https://github.com/y-scope/clp-ffi-java
clp-ffi-java
^^^
A Java library exposing an interface to CLP's core. It currently supports CLP's encoding, decoding,
and query-generation logic as well as serializing CLP IR files.

:::{grid-item-card}
:link: https://github.com/y-scope/yscope-log-viewer
YScope Log Viewer (yscope-log-viewer)
^^^
A web interface for viewing logs that use CLPâ€™s IR stream format including features like filtering
by log level and viewing large files.
