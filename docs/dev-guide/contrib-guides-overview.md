# Overview

This section contains contribution guidelines for different languages and tools. Where possible, we
have automated linting processes so that you don't need to read and remember dozens of guidelines.
Thus, the guidelines here are only those for which we cannot or have not yet automated.

:::{note}
This section is a work in progress while we open-source all our guidelines.
